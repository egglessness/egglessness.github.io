Hi there! My name is Daniele and I'm a computer engineering student @University of Bologna. ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹  

Yeah, I know ...  
I do have a thing about computer security, since I think it is one of the most challenging CS areas, where creativity and finding unconventional solutions can play a big role when trying to solve a problem.

I've been reading lots of different blog posts over the past few years and, thanks to the people that took their time to write about their discoveries and thoughts, I learned a lot.  
I decided to begin writing on this blog to give my support to the whole community ðŸ™ƒ

Computers aside, I have plenty of passions, ranging from what are, in general, visual arts (photography, cinematography, video editing, graphic design and UX) to music.   
In short, I'm that kind of person which always has something running through his head. ðŸ¤£
