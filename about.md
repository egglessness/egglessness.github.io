Hi there! My name is Daniele and I'm a fellow researcher @ University of Bologna. üáÆüáπ  

I'm passionate about computer security, especially low-level stuff like compilers, binary exploitation and malware analysis. I always liked the "hacker's" way of solving problems: use something that was designed to do a specific job, find peculiarities in its inner workings, then exploiting its behaviour to achieve your goals.

Over the past few years, I've been reading lots of different blog posts on many security-related subjects, thanks to the people that took their time to write about their discoveries and thoughts.   
I learned a lot. 

I decided to begin writing on this blog to share what I learned while experimenting on my own. Also, this is a good way to practise my English writing skills.

Computers aside, I have plenty of passions, ranging from what are, in general, visual arts (photography, cinematography, video editing, graphic design and UX) to music.   
In short, I'm that kind of person which always has something running through his head. ü§£
